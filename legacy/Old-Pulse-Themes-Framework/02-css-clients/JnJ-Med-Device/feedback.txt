I took a look and have some recommendations for css tweaks as outlined below.
The biggest thing is the specific shade of red should be updated to J&J’s red,
for which the hex code is #ca001b.




----- Parent DIV
Remove all border styles (leave shadow as-is)

Increase width (max width) to get heading all one line (here at 350)

  Alt: decrease width to get more of heading on second line

  Alt 2: leave width the same (320px) but do a hard break on the heading
  to split more evenly into two lines



----- ----- Close Button
Font color should be same grey as bottom “Pulse Insights” text at bottom

Shown here as #63666a (requires changing both elements); could instead be
the same as the current “Pulse Insights”

Increase space from top and left (shown here at 20px, 20px)

Increase close button size (here 25px)

Hover state – color #ca001b

  Alt: same hover color as “Pulse Insights” text at bottom



----- ----- Survey Heading
Font weight black (900)



----- ----- Options
Background color #ca001b
Border radius: 2px
Border color: #ca001b
Remove hover state
Font weight: 900 (black)



----- ----- “Pulse Insights” Footer Text
Font color – same as close “X”
Shown here as #63666a
Increase space from bottom and right (shown here at 20px, 20px – same as close “X”)
Decrease space between text and list options (ideally same amount of space as btwn “X” and heading)



----- ----- Not Pictured
Recommend having the survey box stick to the right (aligned with rightmost margin & elements) and positioned as vertically centered on the user’s browser
Recommend not having the survey ever overlap with global nav or footer
