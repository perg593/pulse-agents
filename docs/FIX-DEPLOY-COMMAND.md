# ‚úÖ Build Fixed! Now Fix Deploy Command

The build is now working! However, Cloudflare Pages is trying to run `npx wrangler deploy` which is for Workers, not Pages.

## Quick Fix in Cloudflare Dashboard

1. Go to your Cloudflare Pages project: `pulse-agents`
2. Click **"Settings"** tab
3. Scroll down to **"Builds & deployments"**
4. Find **"Deploy command"** field
5. **Clear it** (set to empty/blank)
6. Click **"Save"**

Cloudflare Pages will automatically deploy your files after the build - you don't need a deploy command!

## What Happened

- ‚úÖ Build command: `npm run build` - **Working!** (skips gracefully if theme-generator missing)
- ‚ùå Deploy command: `npx wrangler deploy` - **Remove this!** (Pages handles deployment automatically)

After you remove the deploy command, Cloudflare Pages will:
1. Run the build ‚úÖ
2. Automatically deploy the files ‚úÖ
3. Your site will be live! üéâ

## Alternative: Check if Auto-Deploy is Enabled

Also verify:
- **"Auto-deploy from Git"** is enabled
- Production branch: `main`

That's it! Once you remove the deploy command, it should work perfectly.
