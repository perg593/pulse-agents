## 6. Accessibility & Contrast

The Theme Engine must:

* Check contrast between:

  * Single-choice button text vs background.
  * CTA text vs background.
  * Body text vs widget background.
  * Slider thumb vs track.
* Enforce minimum contrast thresholds (inspired by WCAG).
* If initial colors don’t meet thresholds:

  * Adjust them slightly (darken/lighten).
  * Record the adjustments in metadata, if useful.

This is critical for:

* Clients in regulated industries.
* Mobile readability.
* General UX quality.
