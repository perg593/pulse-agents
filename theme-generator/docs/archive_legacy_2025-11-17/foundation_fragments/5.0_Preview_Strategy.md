## 5. Preview Strategy

Two main approaches:

### 5.1 Simulated HTML (Primary for v1)

* Use HTML fragments that match **Pulse’s survey markup**:

  * Single-choice question
  * Multi-choice
  * Slider
  * Input
  * CTA buttons
* Render these fragments inside the app and apply the generated CSS.
* Benefits:

  * Fully controlled.
  * Easy to version alongside the template.
* Risk:

  * Can drift from real widget if Pulse markup changes (mitigated with template versioning and periodic syncs).

### 5.2 Optional “Real Pulse” Preview (Later)

* Use a dedicated Pulse test account/environment.
* Render a real survey via:

  * Pulse snippet on a test page.
  * Apply generated CSS via a `<style>` tag or external file.
* Benefits:

  * Confidence that themes behave correctly in production context.
* Costs:

  * More moving parts: account, snippet, environment, auth.
  * Needs integration and coordination with core Pulse stack.

**Recommendation:**

* v1: Simulated HTML preview inside the app.
* Later: Add a “Preview in real Pulse” link that opens a test page styled with the generated theme.
