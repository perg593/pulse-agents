## 0. Purpose

Build a **Theme Generation app for Pulse Insights** that:

* Analyzes a client website.
* Generates **4 production-ready Pulse themes**.
* Lets users **preview and refine** those themes (especially on mobile).
* Outputs **CSS** that can be pasted directly into the Pulse console.
* Over time, learns from **existing Pulse themes (CSS/SCSS)** to get smarter.

The app should be usable by internal folks (you + devs) and eventually by non-devs (CSMs, designers) to quickly produce high-quality themes that match a site’s look and feel.

Cursor + GitHub are the primary dev tools. Cursor can handle all git/branching mechanics; this document is the **conceptual blueprint**.
