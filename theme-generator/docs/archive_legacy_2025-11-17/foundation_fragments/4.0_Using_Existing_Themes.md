## 4. Using Existing CSS/SCSS Themes

You already have:

* Many **CSS themes** used in production.
* Many **SCSS files** with maps, mixins, variables.

These should be used as **inputs to design the system**, not just content.

Usage:

1. **Schema Discovery**

   * Analyze existing SCSS/CSS to extract:

     * Common variables
     * Common patterns
     * Range of values and design patterns.
   * Use this to:

     * Inform the Theme Tokens schema.
     * Inform the SCSS Theme Template.

2. **Template Creation**

   * Create a canonical `theme-template.scss` that:

     * Encodes how Pulse components should be styled.
     * Replaces hard-coded values with variables/maps compatible with Theme Tokens.

3. **Optionally: Training Set for Later ML**

   * Once Theme Tokens are defined:

     * Map existing themes into tokens.
     * Use this pool later to train or guide:

       * More advanced auto-generation.
       * Better heuristics for dark/light variants.
   * This is a future phase, not required for v1.
