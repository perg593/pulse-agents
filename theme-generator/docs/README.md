# Theme Designer Specifications

This repository tracks all design documents, phase specs, Cursor prompts, and implementation summaries for the Pulse Insights Theme Designer project.

Each folder represents a logical phase of development (4.x Editor Core, 5.x Pulse Integration, 6.x Runtime).

If you’re continuing work in ChatGPT or Cursor:
1. Copy the phase spec you’re implementing.  
2. Paste it into your Cursor prompt.  
3. Commit the resulting implementation summary here when done.
