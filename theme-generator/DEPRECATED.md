# ⚠️ DEPRECATED - Use Preview Dashboard Instead

This `index.html` file has been **deprecated** and is no longer maintained.

## 🎯 Please Use Instead

**Preview Dashboard**: `preview/index.html` (serve the repo root → `http://localhost:8000/preview/index.html`, which redirects to `preview/basic/index.html`; the modular v3 prototype lives at `preview/v3/index.html`)

## 📋 What's Available in the Main Interface

- ✅ Streamlined survey + theme demo workflow (basic preview)
- ✅ On-demand theme generation from any URL
- ✅ Behavioural triggers and tag diagnostics
- ✅ Access to exploratory, fully modular v3 prototype when needed

> The older matrix of embedded widget fixtures now lives in the v3 prototype (`/preview/v3/`).

## 🔄 Migration

All features from this deprecated interface have been consolidated into the new preview dashboard (`preview/index.html`). The dashboard provides:

- Better organization
- More features
- Active maintenance
- Consistent updates

## 📁 File Status

- This file remains for historical context only.
- Theme generation scripts continue to live in this directory (`main.js`, `theme-generator.js`, `generate-theme-v2.mjs`).
- Use the preview dashboard for all widget/theme visualisation.

## 🛠️ Theme Generation

The theme generation functionality remains active in this directory:
- `main.js` - Main theme generation script
- `theme-generator.js` - Theme generation logic
- `analyze-site.js` - Website analysis
- `output/` - Generated themes (used by main interface)

**Last Updated**: October 2, 2025  
**Status**: Deprecated – Use preview/basic/index.html (or `/preview/v3/` for the prototype)
